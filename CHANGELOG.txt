---------------------------------20/9/2015--------------------------------------

- Remade Runway to fit in better with Background, as well as resizing from 600x120 to 700x140
- Slowed rate of acceleration and deceleration to add realism (still need tweaking to make smoother)
- Changed collision detection for coordinate detection, so that lands on white line on the runway, and detects when it crashed with the water or runway
- Implemented crash mechanic, everything is stopped when it collides with anything, partially implemented replay button (is invisible and has no slot connected yet) and now uses RC to determine whether it crashed or landed, as well as different coordinates to see if it is on the runway or crashed against the rocks. Also displays text when the crash bool is true (set by crash detection mechanic)
- Fixed altitude displayed so it shows correctly, before up was down and down was up (common mishap in Qt with its scene coordinate system)
- Implemented brakes (not tested) to decrease speed gradually
- RC changes more radically either way, but now changes more on negative pitch than on positive one (still needs work to finalize)
- Added all relevant data to be displayed with text on screen, and updates at 30fps (as all other calculations do, with a bit of offset since all timers start at different times)
- Corrected minor math issues, such as negatives, doubles and ints for better function
- Added descriptions in the source files about each class (except main)
- Changed the way altitude is measured, instead of using scene coordinates, multiplies them by a constant to make the max altitude higher and improve density of air calculations for improved accuracy
- Added key input recognition for spoilers, flaps (up and down) and brakes

---------------------------------21/9/2015--------------------------------------
- Added replay and exit buttons after crash (almost fully functional, replay for some reason always thinks you crashed after using replay button), should be fixed in the next day or two
- Modified spoilers so that they control the climb more (speed reducing functionality deleted, may reimplement later on)
- Brakes are now functioning, didn't work yesterday
- Data displayed on screen now doesn't go off the left side of the view like it used to
- Fixed minor errors
- Updated list of remaining issues in main.cpp
- Fixed drag (was using abs() instead of fabs(), fabs() is for doubles/floats and abs() for ints)
- Only missing Plane QPixmap and fix rotation system so that it rotates smooter. Also replay button needs fixing as plane does not show up after releasing button
---------------------------------22/9/2015--------------------------------------
- Changed sky and sea colour + changed "waves" to make look better in Background.png , changed Runway.png to have grass (various shades), flowers (three colours), smoother/better looking rocks (changed divisory lines and colours), added white lines to runway (with piano tiles at supposed landing position and added Plane.png (based off Cessna 172), only grayscale for now (WIP)
---------------------------------23/9/2015--------------------------------------
- Tweaked RC a bit so that climb and descent are not equal and are more radical (prevents unrealistic angles from happening while descending or ascending)
- Implemented event for when landing is completed succesfuly (almost identical to crash)
- Cleaned up some code to make more compact
- Updated Plane.png with colors and resized the image so that it should now touch the runway instead of floating above it
- Fixed Replay button (finally working, airplane coordinates needed to be re-established after crash)
- Implemented multi-key recognition, so movement of aircraft is waaaaaaay smoother than before
- Fixed glitches encountered after implementing multi-key recognition, such as unlimited speed and random sky fallouts
- Updated Background.png and Runway.png, added some bluring of clouds and rocks
- Cleaned up some code, started removing debugging features (still work to be done)
