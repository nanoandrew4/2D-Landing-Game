# 2D-Landing-Game
First Game made by me, in C++ and Qt, objective is to land a plane on a runway.

Controls are:
Up and Down arrows for increase or decrease in thrust respectively
Left and Right arrows for increase or decrease in pitch respectively (to a max of 90ยบ)
F, S and B are flaps (increase flap angle with F, decrease with G), spoilers and brakes respectively, flaps slow down the plane and increase lift, spoilers decrease RC (Rate of Climb) by a bit to make flight more stable, and brakes decrease speed of the plane when on the runway (won't work unless on the runway)
